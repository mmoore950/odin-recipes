        This chicken thigh recipe is a quick and delicious meal that anyone can make
        in only 20 minutes! By uising boneless and skinless thighs, not only does
        the chicken cook more evenly in the airfryer, but it is healthier, and 
        involves less cleanup and grease than normal bone-in, skin-on thighs would.

            For this recipe, you are going to need 1-1.5lbs of boneless chicken thighs,
            or as many as can comfortably fit in your airfryer. Begin by coating them in 
            olive oil, and your seasonings of choice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the chicken thighs are thoroughly seasoned, you should cook them in
            the airfryer for 12 minutes at 400 degrees F, flipping halfway through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, place the chicken thighs straight on a medium-high heat non stick pan
            that is already heated, such that the thighs can develop the crust that we are
            looking for. About 2 minutes each side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, remove the chicken thighs from the pan, and let them rest for 5 minutes
            before eating. Enjoy!
        </li>
